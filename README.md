# Adafruit_FONA_mod
Modified Arduino Library to effortlessly communicate with SIM modules.

While I was working on SafEve_Device (https://github.com/ajwad-shaikh/SafeEve_Device), I found that using the original library on SIM800L sends only blank SMSes to any number.
Since then, I have played around with the .cpp code to somehow fix the problem.
With this modified version, you can now effortlessly send messages.

Other parts of the original code remain untouched thereby may cause errors.
